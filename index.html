    <h1>All about Wendy</h1>
    <p>STEM lover and enthusiast. Biomedical engineer turned junior Rails developer with a passion to explore, problem solve and teach. I am currently seeking for an environment where I can hone my skills in web development, software and hardware interface with the likes of Arduinos, Raspberry Pi's and learn more about robotics in general. I am fond of group projects, pair programming and giving and receiving kind and actionable feedback. I love collaborating in ideas that can potentially revolutionize tech in general and encourage the involvement of children, girls in particular, into tech.</p>
